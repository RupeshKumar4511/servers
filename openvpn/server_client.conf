Implementing OpenVPN typically involves setting up both a server and client. OpenVPN is a robust and secure VPN solution that works across a variety of operating systems. Hereâ€™s a general guide to help you get started with the process:
1. Setting up OpenVPN Server:
1.1. Install OpenVPN Server

    On a Linux server (example: Ubuntu):

        Update your system:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

Install OpenVPN and Easy-RSA:

sudo apt install openvpn easy-rsa

Install ufw (if not already installed) and configure firewall rules:

        sudo apt install ufw
        sudo ufw allow OpenVPN
        sudo ufw enable

    On a Windows Server (for OpenVPN):

        Download the OpenVPN installer from OpenVPN Downloads.

        Follow the installation wizard and ensure the TAP adapter is installed as well.

1.2. Set up the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

OpenVPN uses certificates to authenticate and encrypt traffic. Easy-RSA is a tool that helps you generate the necessary certificates and keys.

    Set up the Easy-RSA variables:

        Create and move to the Easy-RSA directory:

    make-cadir ~/openvpn-ca
    cd ~/openvpn-ca

Edit the vars file:

    Open the vars file and edit it with your details:

    nano vars

    Set parameters like KEY_COUNTRY, KEY_PROVINCE, etc.

Build the Certificate Authority (CA):

    Run these commands to create the CA:

    source vars
    ./clean-all
    ./build-ca

Generate Server Certificate and Key:

./build-key-server server

Generate Diffie-Hellman Parameters:

./build-dh

Generate HMAC Key:

openvpn --genkey --secret keys/ta.key

Copy certificates to the OpenVPN directory:

    sudo cp keys/{server.crt,server.key,ca.crt,ta.key,dh2048.pem} /etc/openvpn

1.3. Configure the OpenVPN Server

    Edit the OpenVPN server configuration file:

        Create a new config file at /etc/openvpn/server.conf or modify the default one:

sudo nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf

Example server.conf settings:

    port 1194
    proto udp
    dev tun
    ca /etc/openvpn/ca.crt
    cert /etc/openvpn/server.crt
    key /etc/openvpn/server.key
    dh /etc/openvpn/dh2048.pem
    server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
    push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"
    push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8"
    push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.4.4"
    keepalive 10 120
    cipher AES-256-CBC
    auth SHA256
    user nobody
    group nogroup
    persist-key
    persist-tun
    status /var/log/openvpn-status.log
    log /var/log/openvpn.log
    verb 3

Enable IP forwarding:

    To allow the server to route traffic, enable IP forwarding in /etc/sysctl.conf:

sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

Uncomment the line:

net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Then, apply the changes:

    sudo sysctl -p

Start OpenVPN server:

    sudo systemctl start openvpn@server
    sudo systemctl enable openvpn@server

2. Setting up OpenVPN Client:
2.1. Install OpenVPN Client

    On Linux Client (Ubuntu):

    sudo apt update && sudo apt install openvpn

    On Windows:

        Download and install the OpenVPN client from the OpenVPN Website.

2.2. Create Client Certificates

    Generate Client Certificate (on the OpenVPN server):

cd ~/openvpn-ca
source vars
./build-key client1

Copy the following files to the client machine:

    client1.crt

    client1.key

    ca.crt

    ta.key

Create a client configuration file (client1.ovpn), which will be used by the OpenVPN client: Example client1.ovpn:

    client
    dev tun
    proto udp
    remote <Your_Server_IP> 1194
    resolv-retry infinite
    nobind
    persist-key
    persist-tun
    ca ca.crt
    cert client1.crt
    key client1.key
    tls-auth ta.key 1
    cipher AES-256-CBC
    auth SHA256
    verb 3

        Replace <Your_Server_IP> with the public IP address of your OpenVPN server.

2.3. Connect the Client to the Server

    On Linux:

        Run the following command:

        sudo openvpn --config client1.ovpn

    On Windows:

        Open the OpenVPN GUI, right-click the OpenVPN icon in the taskbar, and select Connect using the client1.ovpn file.

3. Verify the VPN Connection

    Server-side: Check the OpenVPN logs (/var/log/openvpn.log) to ensure there are no errors.

    Client-side: Verify that the connection is successful by checking the IP address (curl ifconfig.me on Linux or using a similar tool on Windows).
